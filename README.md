## Description

The Note Taker application is a user-friendly web tool designed for creating and organizing notes, offering a seamless experience for users to jot down and manage their tasks and ideas. It features an intuitive interface with functionalities to add, view, and save notes, enhancing personal or business productivity through efficient note management.

## Technologies Used

This project is powered by Express.js, Node.js (v16.19.1), and JavaScript. It utilizes uniqid (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager) as dependencies, and utilized an application called Insomnia to test GET, POST, and DELETE request routes without needing a front end framework built out.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/lvanness7690/Note-Taker.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install express and uniqid directly from the command line, to do so the command for express will be npm i express to install the latests version of Express framework globally so that it can be used within the node terminal, and npm i uniqid to install the latest version of uniqid).

6. To run the server, within the terminal, type the command npm start or node server.js.

7. Once the server is running, users can then access the front end of the application within the browser to observe full functionality of the site.
